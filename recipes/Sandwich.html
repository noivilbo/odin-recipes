    <h1>Sandwich</h1>
    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            A classic ham and cheese sandwich is made by layering slices of ham and cheese between two pieces of bread, optionally adding butter or mayonnaise for extra flavor. It's a simple, quick,
            and tasty meal that can be enjoyed as-is or toasted for a warm, crispy bite.

                <li>
                    Prep the Bread: Start by spreading butter or mayonnaise on one or both slices of bread (optional, but it adds flavor and moisture).

                 Layer the Ham & Cheese: Place a slice of cheese on one slice of bread, then layer the ham on top. Add the second slice of cheese on top of the ham, and place the other slice of bread on top to form the sandwich.

                    Add Extras: If you'd like, add a few leaves of lettuce or slices of tomato for extra crunch and freshness.
