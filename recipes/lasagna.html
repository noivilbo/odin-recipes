    <h1>Lasagna</h1>
    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Lasagna is a rich, hearty Italian dish made by layering wide pasta sheets with a savory meat sauce, 
            creamy béchamel or ricotta, and plenty of melted cheese—usually mozzarella and Parmesan.
         Baked until bubbling and golden, it’s a comforting meal with layers of flavor and texture in every bite.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Lasagna noodles – 9–12 sheets (regular or no-boil)</li>
                <li>Ground beef or pork – 500g (1 lb)</li>
                <li>Tomato pasta sauce – 2 cups (store-bought or homemade)</li>
                <li>Ricotta cheese – 1 cup (or cottage cheese)</li>
                <li>Shredded mozzarella cheese – 2 cups</li>
                <li>Grated Parmesan cheese – 1/2 cup</li>
                <li>1 egg – (to mix with ricotta, optional)</li>
                <li>Salt & pepper – to taste</li>
                <li>Olive oil – for cooking</li>
            </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>

                    Start by heating a bit of olive oil in a pan and cooking the ground meat over medium heat until it’s nicely browned. Once the meat is cooked through, drain off any extra fat, then add the tomato pasta sauce. 
                    Stir everything together and let it simmer for about 10 to 15 minutes so the flavors blend. Add a bit of salt and pepper to taste.

                <li>
                  While the meat sauce is simmering, prepare the ricotta mixture. In a small bowl, mix the ricotta cheese with one egg and a little salt and pepper. 
                  The egg helps give the cheese layer a creamier texture when baked, but you can leave it out if you prefer.

                    If you're using regular lasagna noodles, cook them in boiling water according to the package instructions until just tender. Once they’re ready, drain them and lay them out on a flat surface or plate so they don’t stick together.
                     If you’re using oven-ready (no-boil) noodles, you can skip this step

                <li>
                    To assemble the lasagna, start by spreading a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom of a baking dish. Then place a layer of noodles on top, followed by a layer of the ricotta mixture, a handful of shredded mozzarella, and a sprinkle of Parmesan. 
                    Keep layering in this order—sauce, noodles, cheese—until all the ingredients are used up, finishing with a final layer of sauce and a generous topping of mozzarella and Parmesan.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cover the lasagna with aluminum foil and bake it in a preheated oven at 375°F (190°C) for 25 minutes. After that, remove the foil and bake for another 15 to 20 minutes, or until the top is golden and bubbling. 
                    Once it’s done, let the lasagna sit for 10 to 15 minutes before cutting and serving so the layers stay together nicely.
